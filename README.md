#  DS3001-ML-PROJECT  
### *Food Healthiness Classifier*  

---

##  Overview
This project explores how machine learning can classify packaged food products as **healthy**, **intermediate**, or **unhealthy** based solely on ingredient lists.  
The dataset originates from the **U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s FoodData Central**.  

The workflow includes:
- Cleaning and merging raw data from multiple sources  
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Applying labeling heuristics and threshold tuning  
- Training and evaluating a classification model to predict food healthiness  

This project was developed for **DS 3001: Machine Learning** and demonstrates an end-to-end ML pipeline: preprocessing, feature extraction, labeling, model training, and evaluation.

##  Environment & Tools

**Platform:** Local development using Visual Studio Code and Jupyter Notebooks  
**Language:** Python 3.11 (virtual environment: `.venv`)  

**Core Libraries**
- `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ data manipulation and numerical computing  
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn` â€“ visualization and EDA  
- `scikit-learn` â€“ feature extraction, model training, and evaluation  
- `pyarrow` â€“ efficient CSV/Parquet handling  
- `re` / `json` â€“ text parsing and labeling logic  

### Environment Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m ipykernel install --user --name ds3001-ml --display-name "Python (ds3001-ml)"
```

##  Reproducing the Analysis

### **Step 1 â€“ Preprocessing**
Open `WORKSPACE/Preprocessing.ipynb` and run all cells.  
This notebook:
- Loads and cleans raw `food.csv` + `branded_food.csv`  
- Standardizes ingredient strings  
- Merges datasets on `fdc_id`  
- Exports the processed dataset to:

---

### **Step 2 â€“ Exploratory Analysis**
Run:
- `WORKSPACE/Frequency.ipynb` â†’ analyzes ingredient count distributions  
- `WORKSPACE/IngredientPrevalence.ipynb` â†’ identifies top 30 most frequent ingredients  

The following figures will be generated and saved to:


---

### **Step 3 â€“ Modeling & Evaluation**
Run `WORKSPACE/Methodology.ipynb`.  
This notebook:
- Applies heuristic labeling rules to classify foods as **healthy**, **intermediate**, or **unhealthy**  
- Uses TF-IDF to vectorize ingredient text for feature extraction  
- Trains a **Random Forest Classifier** with optimized thresholds  
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-macro metrics  
- Saves visualizations for model performance  

Outputs are stored in:

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Ingredient list lengths vary widely â€” most products contain fewer than 25 components.  
- Common unhealthy indicators: *high fructose corn syrup (HFCS)*, *refined flour*, *preservatives*.  
- Common healthy indicators: *whole grains*, *vegetables*, *legumes*.  
- The Random Forest model achieved approximately **0.82 macro F1-score**, demonstrating strong performance in distinguishing between healthy and unhealthy products using only textual ingredient data.
